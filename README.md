**API** **M**ade **E**asy: A framework for quickly wrapping (RESTful) APIs


### Introduction
This library aims to make writing wrappers for RESTful APIs quick and easy.  
After having to wrap multiple APIs in short succession, I decided to take the time to implement and publish a library for doing the work.  Writing sensible API wrappers should be at least as easy as implementing the API itself.    


### Installation
Install using npm, yarn, or your tool of choice for installing packages.  

    yarn add apime
